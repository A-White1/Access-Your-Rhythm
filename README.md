# Access-Your-Rhythm
Unity C# Rhythm Game with a focus on Accessibility Features.

Made as part of my University final year project, the game is designed with accessibility in mind. 
Only the primary button on any controller or accessibility device is required to play.
The game can be played without hearing, or without sight, as it can be played with either visual or audio cues.


Play directly from the 'AccessYourRhythm.exe' application.
Full source code is too large to fit in the repo, some important scripts are included the folder.
